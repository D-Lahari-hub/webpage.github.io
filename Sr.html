        <img src="pic1.webp">
<pre>            A warm thanks to the Tap Academy team.
            I am Gowtham GM from Tamilnadu, a 2024 passed-out student. 
            I joined Tap Academy as a CSR student in the month of February. 
            My journey with Tap Academy is quite different. 
            The trainers at Tap Academy are skilled and experienced.

            They teach a lot of new concepts and help in learning programming languages from scratch.
            I am from the Computer Science branch, but the teaching at Tap Academy is structured in a
            way that makes it easy for students from all domains to understand the concepts and technology 
            taught by the trainers.

            Finally, I got placed as a Software Engineer at Revature with a package of 3.25 LPA.
            The placement team helped me a lot in securing this job.
            Thank you to the entire Tap Academy team for helping me acquire this opportunity.</pre>

        <img src="pic2.webp">
<pre>            After joining Tap Academy, I have improved my programming skills, 
            and my knowledge of core Java has also improved. Now, I am learning the Collection Framework, 
            MySQL, HTML, and CSS in parallel.

            Through the TAI platform, I have enhanced my problem-solving skills. 
            Additionally, the LMS makes it easy to watch all the recorded videos. 
            They also provide recorded videos of frameworks like J2EE, Spring, Data Structures, etc.
            
            I got placed in Promantia Business Solutions for the role of Associate Technical Consultant 
            with a package of 3 LPA.
            
            Thank you TAP ACADEMY for giving me this opportunity.

<pre>            I'm a student from the Feb 2 batch, and I'm happy to share my experience with Tap Academy. 
            They visited our college in Tamil Nadu and selected students for their CSR batch, offering a 
            free course that's been incredibly helpful. Compared to other academies, Tap Academy stands 
            out for its excellent trainers, who explain complex concepts in a clear and concise manner, 
            start from scratch, making it easy for beginners to understand, and provide in-depth coverage 
            of programming and OOPS concepts, highly valuable for placement opportunities. I'm grateful to 
            have been selected by Avasoft with the role of Trainee Engineer with a package of 5 LPA through 
            college placement, and I attribute my success to Tap Academy's incredible teaching, as I used the 
            same approach they taught me during them mock interview process. Additionally, Tap Academy offers 
            comprehensive notebooks and study materials, an LMS platform with daily class recordings, a 
            TAl platform for practicing daily programming questions, weekly assessments, and monthly mock 
            assessments and Interviews, boosting placement confidence, as well as soft skill classes focusing on 
            logical thinking.</pre>
